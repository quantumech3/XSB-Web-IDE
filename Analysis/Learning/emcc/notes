You can invoke JS from C/C++ using 'emscripten_run_script("command")'
NOTE: You are NOT able to set or declare globals in JS through C or C++ for some reason

You can also create a C/C++ method that invokes JS with the following:
EM_JS(returnType, funcName, (type param1, type param2) {
	// Insert JS code here
});
The advantage to the second way is that you can pass parameters from C/C++ into JS. You cannot directly invoke this method in JS but you can make a C method that calls the function and IS exposed.

EM_ASM(
	// Insert JS code here
);
 is basically emscripten_run_script() except you dont need to encapsulate the JS in quotes as a string.

EM_ASM_ is like EM_ASM except you are able to pass values from C/C++ into it
 EM_ASM_(
	 {
		 // Insert JS code here

		 // Print arg0 (first arg) => 25
		 console.log($0)

		 // Print arg1 (second arg) => 64
		 console.log($1)

		 // You can have as many args as you want, the terms would be $2, $3, etc
	 },
	 25, 64
 );

You can also GET ints and doubles that computed by Javascript with 
	EM_ASM_INT and EM_ASM_DOUBLE respectively

Example:
	// You can still pass params
	
	int a = 4;
	int b = 3;

	// Prints '7'
	printf("%d\n", EM_ASM_INT({
		return $0 + $1;
	}, a, b));
